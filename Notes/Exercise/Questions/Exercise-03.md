**Imagine you have a chessboard and put a single grain of rice on one square. On the second square, you put 2 grains of rice, since that is double the amount of rice on the previous square. On the third square, you put 4 grains and on the fourth square you put 8 grains. The pattern continues like that.**

**Write a function calculates which square you will need to place a certain number of rice grains. For example, for 16 grains, the function will return 5. Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of that function.**
